# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Using supervised machine learning to analyze credit risk

## Overview
A lending service tasked me with determining the credit risk of loans using multiple machine learning models. Using Random Oversampling, SMOTE, Cluster Centroids, SMOTEENN, Balanced Random Forest Classifier, and Easy Ensemble Classifier, on the same test data and under the same conditions I was able to compare the results of the machine learning models.
